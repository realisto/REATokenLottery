# REATokenLottery

Here we publish all the eligible participants of the REALISTO token raffle.

The winning ticket number will be chosen by sending a transaction on the Ethereum Network with a very low Gas Price, this way it canÂ´t be forseen in which block the transaction will be written because of a delay.

The last two digits of the hash of the block number modulo the total number of the participants of the lottery round will be the winning number of the raffle.

The ticket numbers corresponding to contributions will be choosen pseudo randomly by a computer program and published here.
